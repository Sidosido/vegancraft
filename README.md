# Daenvil's Vegancraft
A datapack/collection of datapacks which makes a vegan gamestyle possible in a vanilla-like way without missing any game features.

You can either download the full collection in a single datapack or download the individual datapacks as desired.

You can check the full info of this project on its webpage: [daenvil.github.io/MCDatapacks/vegancraft.html](http://daenvil.github.io/MCDatapacks/vegancraft.html)
